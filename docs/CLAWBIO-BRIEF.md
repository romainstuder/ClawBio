# ClawBio Brief

![ClawBio Logo](../img/clawbio-logo.jpeg)

**Use this brief to explain ClawBio to collaborators, researchers, workshop organisers, and funders. It can also serve as a quick orientation document for AI agents working from the repository docs.**

## What is ClawBio?

ClawBio is a bioinformatics skill library for local, reproducible genomic analysis. It gives AI agents two things they otherwise lack in computational biology:

- **Skill wrapping**: a consistent way to interact with specialist tools and workflows through documented inputs, outputs, commands, safety constraints, and reproducibility artifacts.
- **Routing**: a way to decide which specialist skill or agent should handle a request, and what information needs to be retrieved or forwarded between steps.

Both are designed for local execution: biological data does not leave the researcher's machine unless a workflow explicitly uses an external source.

At a high level, ClawBio provides documented workflows for pharmacogenomics, GWAS lookup, PRS calculation, UK Biobank exploration, fine-mapping, and sequencing analysis, with clear inputs, outputs, and reproducibility artifacts.

## How It Relates to OpenClaw

ClawBio is built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw/OpenClaw), an agent framework for persistent, tool-using AI systems. OpenClaw provides the runtime and skill model; ClawBio adds the bioinformatics layer: domain-specific skills, safety constraints, demo data, reproducibility conventions, and project documentation.

## Why It Matters

ClawBio exists to solve three recurring problems in computational biology:

1. **Privacy**: genomic and biomedical data often cannot be uploaded to external services.
2. **Reproducibility**: analyses need reports, commands, environments, and checksums that another researcher can verify.
3. **Domain grounding**: general-purpose agents are not reliable enough to improvise sensitive bioinformatics logic from scratch.

ClawBio addresses this by combining local execution, versioned skill specifications, Python implementations, demo datasets, and reproducibility bundles.

## Current Project State

As documented in `README.md`, ClawBio is currently presented as:

- **v0.5.0** of the project
- **55 skills** in the broader platform framing
- **8,000+ Galaxy tools**
- **1,401 tests + benchmark validation**
- a local-first bioinformatics stack with privacy and reproducibility as core constraints

The current public skills table in `README.md` lists **43 named skills**, comprising:

- **37 MVP skills**
- **6 planned skills**

This is a substantial expansion from the older brief, which described the project as having 7 production skills and 6 planned skills.

## How ClawBio Works

In the repository, routing (when used) is handled by the **Bio Orchestrator** skill (`skills/bio-orchestrator/`), which looks at file types, table headers, keywords, and explicit user choices. Direct CLI/API calls can bypass routing entirely by naming a skill explicitly.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    request["User request or input file"]
    classified["Input and intent classified"]
    selected["Suitable skill selected"]
    launched["Skill run launched"]
    analysed["Domain analysis completed"]
    artifacts["Report + tables + figures + reproducibility bundle"]

    request -->|"Bio Orchestrator detects file type, headers, and intent"| classified
    classified -->|"Bio Orchestrator selects a suitable skill from the registry"| selected
    request -->|"User names a skill directly via CLI/API"| launched
    selected -->|"clawbio.py validates the selected skill and allowed flags"| launched
    launched -->|"Specialist skill script runs its documented method"| analysed
    analysed -->|"Specialist skill writes its outputs"| artifacts
```

The diagram separates **selection** from **execution**. Bio Orchestrator first detects what kind of input or request it has received, then selects a suitable skill from the available registry. A user can override that suggestion by naming a skill directly through the CLI or API. `clawbio.py` then validates and launches the selected skill. The specialist skill performs the scientific work and is responsible for writing the report, tables, figures, and structured `result.json`. Where supported, reproducibility artifacts include `commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, and checksums. The structured `result.json` fields are summarised in [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md#structured-next-steps).

Some skills use shared helper code for standardised metadata, disclaimers, checksums, or replay commands, but that is an implementation detail for developers rather than a separate agent role.

## Why ClawBio Is Different

ClawBio differs from ad hoc LLM-assisted bioinformatics workflows in a few practical ways:

- **Local execution**: data stays on the researcher's machine unless a workflow explicitly uses an external source.
- **Documented methods**: domain logic is recorded in `SKILL.md`, together with implementation details and operating constraints.
- **Reproducible outputs**: analyses produce reusable artifacts, not just chat responses.
- **Modular structure**: skills can be developed, tested, and improved independently.
- **Readable project metadata**: the repository includes documentation and machine-readable indexes that help both contributors and software agents navigate the project.

## Who This Is For

- **Researchers** who want local, inspectable analyses instead of opaque cloud workflows
- **Tool builders** who want to package methods as reusable skills
- **Collaborators and funders** who need a concise picture of project maturity and trajectory
- **AI agents and automation tools** that need explicit project structure, capabilities, and execution guidance

## Historical Notes

The original February 2026 meetup context that launched this brief has been archived separately in [docs/talks/london-bioinformatics-meetup-2026.md](talks/london-bioinformatics-meetup-2026.md). That material remains useful as project history, but it is no longer the framing for the main ClawBio brief.

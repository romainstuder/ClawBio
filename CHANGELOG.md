## [Unreleased]

### New Skills
- **nfcore-scrnaseq-wrapper** (`skills/nfcore-scrnaseq-wrapper/`, `scrnaseq-pipeline`): Upstream single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing from FASTQ using nf-core/scrnaseq. Supports six presets (simpleaf/standard, STARsolo/star, kallisto, cellranger, cellrangerarc, cellrangermulti), strict preflight for Java/Nextflow/backend, samplesheet validation, `params.yaml`-driven execution, SHA-256 reproducibility bundle, and automatic handoff to `scrna-orchestrator` (via `--run-downstream`). Includes macOS/Apple Silicon Docker workaround. 282 tests.
- **nfcore-rnaseq-wrapper** (`skills/nfcore-rnaseq-wrapper/`, `rnaseq-pipeline`): Upstream bulk RNA-seq preprocessing from FASTQ/BAM using nf-core/rnaseq v3.26.0. Supports STAR+Salmon, STAR+RSEM, HISAT2, and Bowtie2+Salmon routes; strict preflight for Java/Nextflow/backend, samplesheet strandedness and references; `params.yaml`-driven execution; SHA-256 reproducibility bundle; provenance JSONs; and template handoff to `rnaseq-de`. Hardening round: contaminant screening (`--contaminant-screening`, `--kraken-db`, `--sylph-db`, `--bracken-precision`, BBSplit auto-enable), iGenomes name validation with fast-fail in preflight, GENCODE GTF auto-detect, real `duration_seconds` measurement, auto-handoff to `rnaseq-de` (`--run-downstream --metadata --formula --contrast`), `--prokaryotic` restricted to profile modifier (never standalone backend), `--check` guaranteed to never invoke Nextflow, passthrough flags `--enable-preseq`, `--multiqc-config`, `--multiqc-logo`, `--rsem-extra-args`. 538 tests.

## [v0.5.0] — 2026-04-04 — Validation & Benchmark Infrastructure

### Added
- **AD Ground Truth Benchmark Set** (`tests/benchmark/ad_ground_truth.json`): Curated set of 34 positive Alzheimer's disease genes across 3 evidence tiers (4 Mendelian causal, 20 GWAS-replicated from Bellenguez 2022, 10 novel Bellenguez), 20 brain-expressed negative control genes, 10 lead variants with GRCh38 coordinates, and scoring criteria with minimum acceptable thresholds. This is the first disease-specific validation dataset for any agentic bioinformatics platform.
- **Mock API Server** (`tests/benchmark/mock_api_server.py`): Deterministic mock endpoints for Ensembl REST, GWAS Catalog, and ClinPGx APIs. Threaded HTTP server with context manager for test integration. Enables offline CI testing without rate limits or API drift. Inspired by StrongDM's simulated Slack/Jira pattern.
- **Benchmark Scorer** (`tests/benchmark/benchmark_scorer.py`): Scores pipeline outputs against ground truth using gene recovery rate, false discovery rate, precision, recall, F1, and tier-weighted composite score. CLI and Python API. Outputs markdown reports with tier breakdown.
- **Swappable Fine-Mapping Pipeline** (`tests/benchmark/finemapping_benchmark.py`): First autoresearch-style benchmark. Runs ABF and SuSiE fine-mapping on the same synthetic locus with known causal signals, scores each method on recall, precision, PIP concentration, credible set size, and composite score, picks the winner. Method registry pattern: adding FINEMAP or PolyFun requires only a single function. First result: SuSiE wins (composite=0.80) vs ABF (composite=0.65).
- **Nightly Sweep Benchmark Integration** (`scripts/nightly_demo_sweep.py`): Nightly demo sweep now collects gene lists from skill outputs and scores them against the AD ground truth. Reports gene recovery rate, FDR, precision, recall, F1, and tier breakdown in the sweep summary. Benchmark section appears when `--output` is used.
- **Red/Green TDD Mandate** (`CLAUDE.md`): All skill development and modification must use test-driven development. Tests first, watch them fail, implement, watch them pass. Contributing workflow updated to enforce this.
- **74 benchmark tests** across ground truth integrity (8), mock API responses (5), HTTP endpoints (6), benchmark scoring (9), fine-mapping locus generation (7), method runners (6), scoring logic (3), benchmark runner (3), and reference genome (27). All green.
